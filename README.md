# EC551_TeamAxx
Team Axx decided to make "FPGA Hero" - an FPGA version of "Guitar Hero" - for their Digital Design final project.
The game runs on a Nexys 7 FPGA. 
External hardware consists of three main components: VGA output, speaker output, and keyboard input.
The keyboard is used to select one of four falling tiles on the VGA display. If the tile is hit at the correct time, the user scores a point. Each note output by the speaker is generated by dividing the board's 100MHz clock. Frequency determines a note's pitch.
